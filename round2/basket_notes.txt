    spread = basket1-synth spread
    long basket1, short synth
    long spread we'd want basket1+ and synth-

    spread being positive = basket1 overvalued synthetic undervalued

    spread z-score being above 5 = basket1 overvalued by much more than it should be and synth being much more undervalued
    we expect this to revert to current window mean
    so short spread by selling basket 1 and buying synth1

    should we use best bid/ask or swmid?
    case for using best bid/ask:
    - to long spread we'd match with market ask for basket1 and market bid for synth
    - use best bid/ask values of this to calculate price of spread
    

    window of mean prices for spread
    same for standard deviation
    calculate z-score of current swmid for spread
    if z-score > threshold: short spread
    if z-score < -threshold: long spread

    value synth buy buying individual components

    we want to either buy or sell synth / 


    dealing with not enough volume to buy/sell synth?

    modify order depth to add synthetic order volume and later parse into components in post-processing


    how do we buy synthetic and display synthetic volumes, we obv never buy components individually

    creating order depth for synthetic

    if there are 20 strawberries, 5 jams, 2 djembes -> for 6, 3, 1 it translates to volume of 1 synthetic at whatever price is being displayed

    for 2 synthetics, we'd pick off volume from other price levels which prices our components differently

    "there are thousands of unique combinations like this, how do we determine which ones to examine? do we examine all of them? build a systematic way of examining them?\n",
    "\n",
    "some approaches can include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- at runtime, we only examine combinations that're possible to make using current order depth volume\n",
    "- if we want to examine larger volumes, we'd have to price in basket lower/higher using worse price levels\n",
    "- we also have our own position to take into account, we can try to continually examine combinations that match our current position and different ways to get to \"synthetic netural\" by trading synthetic equivalent to current position, thus capturing another spread\n",
    "- we can also try to swing as much as possible by effectively capturing optimal spread that moves us closest to position limit on other direction, to maximize our trading volume\n",
    "\n",
    "for analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- different spreads likely have different patterns, with some possibly reverting faster / more stably while others are more volatile\n",
    "- it's possible that different spreads patterns vary across times and days, making it more profitable to trade certain spreads over others\n",
    "\n",
    "theory vs practicality:\n",
    "\n",
    "- cannot examine every combination, have to focus on certain combination\n",
    "- can try to find every matching combination at every timestamp for analysis and plot interval from min and max spread possible at timestamp\n",
    "\n",
    "todo:\n",
    "\n",
    "- synth-spread-generator:\n",
    "    - to begin, use the best bid and ask volume for each tradeable product to generate every synth combination resulting in equivalent position\n",
    "        - for each synth, get the execution price to form that synth\n",
    "        - for each equivalent position, get min and max execution price for synth, use this to calculate spread\n",
    "        - get min spread and max spread across all equivalent positions (which theoretically should be 0)\n",
    "    - next steps: take volume and other price levels into consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "concerns:\n",
    "- synth-spread-generator doesn't take volume into consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "todo above is big, should set milestones towards that with minimum viable implementations that're profitable\n",
    "\n",
    "if we can't do the entire above task, what're the baby steps towards it?\n",
    "\n",
    "- look at a small subet of combinations which have small position sizes that make it likely globally tradeable\n",
    "- find combinations that revert frequently and have mean spread closest to 0 across all days, these would be easiest to trade\n",
    "    - can do this in analysis\n",
    "- build trader to trade these synth spreads"
